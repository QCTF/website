    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div class="problem">
        <p>I have this crossword but I seem to have lost all of the hints.
        However, the answers must be from this list of words.
        Can you figure it out for me?</p>
<pre><code>    #a#######
s   #  #  # #
##s##  r  # #
#   ##########
#   #  #  # #
###t##i######
    s  #  t g
    e  #
       #
</code></pre>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
        As stated in one of the hints,
        this can be thought of as a branch and bound problem.
        There are too many possible permutations
        for brute-forcing to be feasible,
        even if words are only considered for valid lengths / solved letters.
        Thus, one must only consider words which fit into a partial solution,
        and all partial solutions must be considered to find the correct final solution.
